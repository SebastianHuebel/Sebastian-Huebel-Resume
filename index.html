        <p class="lead mb-4">Hello my name is Sebastian Huebel and I am a University of California Riverside first-year undergraduate Pre-Business studying planning on concentrating in Marketing, and eventually moving into the Real Estate field post graduation. Already in my first year at the University of California Riverside, I have had the opportunity to join many clubs and organizations on campus. I have had the chance to join the likes of the American Marketing Association and the Undergraduate Business Association, two very big and professional organizations on campus. Firstly, the American Marketing Association has aided in my efforts to gain critical experience in my prefered concentration field of Marketing by attending meetings every single week, engaging in influential conversation about various and effective marketing strategies. Secondly, I have also the great opportunity to join the Undergraduate Business Association, a notable and professional organization which has provided me the ability to explore the many concentrations in business that UCR has to offer and be able to learn valuable business practices in weekly scheduled meetings that more than encourage conversation and discussion.<br><br>

        Although I am still in the first year of my college experience, I am currently working two jobs in the food industry, one at my university and one at a Mexican Coastal Grill. My first job is at the UCR Lothian Dining Hall where I work as a Student Specialist - Commissary Assistant. From collaborating with a 6 person team to create, prepare, and design delicious food that serves the tens of thousands of students who attend UCR to coordinating efforts in order to promote a clean and safe work environment, this job has given me excellent experience in time management and team-oriented collaboration. My second occupation is at Rubioâ€™s where my job position is that of Line Â¾ cook. From working with a team to make, assemble, and serve mouth-watering, appetizing food that serves thousands of satisfied, this occupation has helped earn valuable experience in responsibility of tasks assigned to myself and additionally being able to work quickly and efficiently in a fast and nerve-racking environment. This position has additionally taught me essential customer service skills that I will be able to take and utilize regardless of the field of work that I decide to work in.<br><br>

        Although in the food industry, I am currently looking for an opportunity in the marketing sector that will help me gain valuable and crucial experience that will be beneficial for my foreseeable future in the field of Real Estate. I would be able to bring youth and charisma to the position and be able to bring energy to the position. Additionally open to opportunities in internship and job form in the field of Real Estate that will aid in my quest to get my foot into the door and be able to sell and buy houses from sellers and buyers, ultimately creating a name for not only my company that I work for, but also including myself. Be sure to check out my Linkedin and other social medias to be able to connect with me and hopefully be able to be in contact soon.
